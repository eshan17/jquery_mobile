This was part of the sixth assignment in a brand new class called Cross-Platform Mobile Web Apps (15-237) at Carnegie Mellon. We had to create a signup/signin form on mobile that would prove the form submitter is human by asking the person to tap and swipe in random order. 
Everything is done on the client-side in javascript, jQuery Mobile, HTML5, and CSS3.
